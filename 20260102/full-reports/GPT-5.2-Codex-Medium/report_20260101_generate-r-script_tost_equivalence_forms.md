## Abstract

This report documents a custom paired TOST analysis used to evaluate mean-score equivalence across STARC-5 forms A, B, and C using a predefined ±0.25 SD margin. The analysis was run on recomputed mean scores from item responses.

# Equivalence Testing for STARC-5 Form Means

## Method

### Participants

N = 53 respondents from the study dataset.

### Measures

STARC-5 A/B/C form scores were recomputed as mean item scores (7 items per form). Equivalence bounds were defined as ±0.25 × pooled SD for each form pair.

### Procedure

Paired differences between forms (A–B, A–C, B–C) were tested using two one-sided tests (TOST) with α = .05 (90% CI).

### Analytic Strategy

For each form pair, equivalence was concluded when both one-sided tests were significant at α = .05. The equivalence margin was computed as ±0.25 × pooled SD for that pair.

## Results

### Hypothesis Testing

The table below summarizes paired TOST results for A–B, A–C, and B–C comparisons.

*Paired TOST Equivalence Results*

| Pair | n | Mean X | Mean Y | Mean Diff | Pooled SD | Delta | 90% CI Low | 90% CI High | TOST p | Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A vs B | 53 | 3.493 | 3.566 | -0.073 | 0.652 | 0.163 | -0.146 | 0.001 | 0.023 | Yes |
| A vs C | 53 | 3.493 | 3.340 | 0.154 | 0.683 | 0.171 | 0.060 | 0.247 | 0.380 | No |
| B vs C | 53 | 3.566 | 3.340 | 0.226 | 0.641 | 0.160 | 0.153 | 0.300 | 0.932 | No |

*Note.* Equivalence margin defined as ±0.25 × pooled SD for each pair; TOST uses 90% confidence intervals and α = .05.

## Discussion

### Summary of Findings

Equivalence decisions are reported per pair above; interpret in light of the predefined margin and sample size.

### Limitations

The equivalence margin is operationalized per pair using pooled SD; alternative operationalizations may yield different conclusions.

### Implications

These results inform whether mean form scores are statistically equivalent within the predefined tolerance.

### Future Directions

Consider preregistered equivalence margins and larger samples for tighter confidence bounds.

## Conclusion

This custom analysis provides TOST-based evidence for or against mean-score equivalence across STARC-5 forms.
