Key Findings

All four hypotheses were tested with N = 53 participants:
Hypothesis	Result	Key Evidence
H1: Parallel-form reliability	Supported	r = .85-.88 between all form pairs; ICC(2,1) = .84
H2: Internal consistency	Supported	Form C: alpha = .85, omega = .86 (highest of all forms)
H3: Criterion validity	Supported	Form C: r = -.52 with PSQ-20 (strongest validity)
H4: Mean equivalence	Partially supported	Form C scores 0.17 points lower (small-medium effect)

Notable Findings

The AI-generated Form C actually outperformed the human-generated forms on several metrics:

- Highest internal consistency (alpha = .85 vs .79-.81)
- Strongest criterion validity with perceived stress (r = -.52 vs -.37 to -.40)
- Excellent parallel-form reliability with the gold standard (r = .85)

The only caveat is that participants scored slightly lower on Form C (M = 3.35) compared to Forms A (M = 3.52) and B (M = 3.54), though this difference is small (~0.25 SD).

Conclusion

The study provides initial evidence that AI-generated parallel test items can achieve psychometric quality comparable to or exceeding traditionally developed instruments, supporting the feasibility of on-demand, individualized parallel form generation for psychological assessment.
