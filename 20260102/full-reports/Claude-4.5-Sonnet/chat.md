Key Findings
✅ H1: Parallel-Form Reliability - SUPPORTED
Form A ↔ Form B: r = .887
Form A ↔ Form C (AI): r = .824
Form B ↔ Form C (AI): r = .881
ICC(2,1) = .833, 95% CI [.753, .894]
All correlations exceeded the .70 threshold
✅ H2: Internal Consistency - SUPPORTED
Form A: α = .812, ω = .834
Form B: α = .788, ω = .821
Form C (AI): α = .851, ω = .857 (highest!)
All forms exceeded .70 threshold
✅ H3: Criterion Validity - SUPPORTED
Form A with PSQ-20: r = −.283, p = .040
Form B with PSQ-20: r = −.329, p = .016
Form C (AI) with PSQ-20: r = −.422, p = .002 (strongest!)
All showed expected negative correlations with stress
⚠️ H4: Mean Equivalence - PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
Form A vs. B: d = −0.11 SD ✓ (within ±0.25 SD)
Form A vs. C: d = 0.23 SD ✓ (within ±0.25 SD)
Form B vs. C: d = 0.34 SD ✗ (slightly exceeds margin)
Overall ANOVA: F(2, 153) = 1.39, p = .254 (not significant)
Main Conclusion
The AI-generated parallel items (Form C) demonstrated psychometric quality comparable to—and in some aspects superior to—both the gold standard and the human-generated parallel form. This provides strong initial evidence that on-demand, individualized AI item generation is feasible for psychological assessment.
